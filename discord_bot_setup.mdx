## OnyxBot Introduction

Onyx will connect to your Discord and listen for questions to answer.

You can easily configure rules for what channels Onyx should respond in, what knowledge sets should back each
configured channel, and set filters to respond or not respond to different types of messages.

When Onyx identifies valid questions, it will respond in the message thread with:

- An LLM generated answer
- Sources with highlighted keywords

Onyx also provides a configuration page so you can create custom settings for each Discord channel
(or you can just use the default settings for all your channels).

Since we are using Web Sockets, Onyx is able to initiate the connection. This means that this is able
to work even if you are running Onyx inside a firewall protected VPC.

## Setting up

### Authorization

**Note:** You must have "Manage Server" permissions in the Discord server to set up the Discord bot.

1. Navigate and sign in to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications). 
2. Create a new Discord app:
   - Click the **New Application** button in the top right.
   - Give your app a name, accept the Terms of Service, and click **Create**.

3. Select the "Bot" tab:
   - Click the **Reset Token** button and copy this token, as you will need this later to connect to Onyx.
   - On this same page, scroll down to the **Privileged Gateway Intents** section and enable all three settings; **Presence Intent**, **Server Members Intent**, and **Message Content Intent**.

4. Now select the "OAuth2" tab:
   - Under scopes in the **OAuth2 URL Generator** section, select **bot** and **applications.commands**
   - Scroll down to **Bot Permissions** and select all of the following permissions:
      - Under General Permissions: **View Channels**
      - Under Text Permissions: **Send Messages**, **Create Public Threads**, **Create Private Threads**, **Send Messages In Threads**, **Manage Messages**, **Manage Threads**, **Embed Links**, **Attach Files**, **Read Message History**, **Add Reactions**, and **Use Slash Commands**
   - Ensure the Integration Type is set to **Guild Install** and then copy the generated URL. You will use this to invite the bot to your server.

4. Select the **Add channel configuration** button, and add any settings you want. Once you submit this, Onyx will start to respond within the set channel after a short startup delay.

There are also a set of less often used / more advanced configuration options available via environment
variables that can set things like how many "Reference Documents" to show per answer, etc.
